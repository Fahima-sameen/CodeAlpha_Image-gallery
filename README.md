# CodeAlpha_Image-gallery 
This repository contains the source code for a responsive image gallery where users can view a collection of images. It utilizes HTML and CSS for the layout, and JavaScript for image navigation and interactive features. This project was created as part of my internship at CodeAlpha.

Features:

Responsive Design: The gallery adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless viewing experience on any device.

Accessibility: Designed with accessibility in mind to ensure a broader audience can enjoy the gallery.

Responsive Grid Layout: Use a responsive grid layout that adjusts image sizes and placement based on screen size for a more aesthetically pleasing arrangement.
